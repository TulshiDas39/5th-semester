- Default image for users without pictures
- Links to unread posts - currently users can only view the title for the unread posts
- Alerts for expired content (Eg. assignments that have expired) which cannot be viewed - currently the page merely refreshes if the content can no longer be viewed
- Facebook Integration - when teacher posts an assignment it will be posted in their messages on facebook
- Notification Settings - users should be able to control whether they will receive notifications or not
- Additional Quiz Types - currently only essay type and multiple choice quiz can be created by teachers. Additional quiz types such as
identification, fill in the blanks, pop-up quiz, matching, ordering, true or false. Multiple choice should also be improved, currently the teacher can only add 5 choices for each quiz item
