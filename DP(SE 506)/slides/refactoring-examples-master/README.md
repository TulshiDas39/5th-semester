# Refactoring Examples

This repository is part of the [Refactoring.Guru](http://refactoring.guru/refactoring) project.

It contains both simple and interactive refactoring examples in different programming languages.


## Contributor's Guide

We appreciate any help, whether it's a simple fix of a typo or a whole new example. Just [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), do your change and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Here's the list of priorities:

1. Simple examples in a programming language, which is not yet present in the repository. These require minimum labor but produce a lot of value. You can just copy the Java folder and translate all of them into your language of choice.

2. Interactive examples. These require more work. See README file in the "interactive" folder. The best way to start is to take the Java scenarios one by one and translate them to your language. You can debug your scenarios by importing them to this editor: http://refactoring.guru/editor/ (You will need to export scenarios from there and do a regular pull request though).
