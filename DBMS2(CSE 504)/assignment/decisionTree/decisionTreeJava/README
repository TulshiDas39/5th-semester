decision-tree
=============

This package consists of several Java classes to construct and apply a decision
tree to a attribute set. It allows for pluggable algorithms to construct the
tree. The decision tree is constructed from a series of examples of attributes,
where each example either has each of the attributes or does not, and each has
a specified outcome of either true or false. The resulting decision tree is a
binary tree where each leaf node represents the presents or absence of each
attribute named along the path to the root node and the resulting outcome for
the set of decisions.
